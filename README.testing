The test framework is a bit weak so far, but it has caught some
regressions so it's already been worth the effort.

Some of the tests use a local Rietveld server.
To set this up:
1) Check out a copy of Rietveld:
   $ svn checkout http://rietveld.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ rietveld-read-only
   (Use git-svn if you must, but man is it slow.)
2) Get the Google App Engine SDK:
   http://code.google.com/appengine/downloads.html

Run Rietveld:
/path/to/appengine/sdk/dev_appserver.py /path/to/rietveld

And then run the tests.
